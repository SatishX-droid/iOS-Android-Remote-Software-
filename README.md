```

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14 or higher
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend folder**:
   ```bash
   cd iOS-Android-Remote-Software/backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create the `database.json` file**:
   ```json
   {
       "users": [],
       "features": {}
   }
   ```

4. **Run the server**:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   The server should run on `http://localhost:3000`. To change the default port, update the `PORT` variable in `server.js`.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend folder**:
   ```bash
   cd iOS-Android-Remote-Software/frontend
   ```

2. **Serve the frontend**:
   You can use a local server (like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VSCode) to view the frontend.

3. **Access the frontend**:
   Open `index.html` in your browser to access the UI.

## API Endpoints

### Authentication

- **POST /signup**: Register a new user
  - Request Body: `{ "username": "user", "password": "pass" }`

- **POST /login**: Log in an existing user
  - Request Body: `{ "username": "user", "password": "pass" }`

### Feature Toggling

- **POST /toggleFeature**: Toggle a monitoring feature on or off
  - Request Body: `{ "feature": "featureName" }`

### Data Endpoint

- **GET /data**: Returns a JSON message to confirm the backend is running.

## Deployment

You can deploy the backend on [Render](https://render.com/) and the frontend on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) as free options.

### Deploy on Render

1. **Create a Render account** and select **New Web Service**.
2. Connect your GitHub repository and specify the backend folder as the root.
3. Set up the build commands:
   - **Build command**: `npm install`
   - **Start command**: `node server.js`
4. Deploy, and Render will provide a public URL for your backend.

### Deploy on Vercel

1. **Create a Vercel account** and select **Import Project**.
2. Connect your GitHub repository and specify the frontend folder as the root.
3. Vercel will assign a public URL for your frontend after deployment.

## Usage

1. **Signup/Login**: Register or log in on the landing page.
2. **Toggle Features**: Once logged in, use the buttons to toggle features such as notifications, gallery, microphone, keystrokes, and file access.

## Troubleshooting

- **Port Already in Use**: If you get a `EADDRINUSE` error, ensure no other application is using the specified port or change it in `server.js`.
- **File System Errors**: Make sure `database.json` exists and has write permissions.
